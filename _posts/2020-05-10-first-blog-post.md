# Learning How GitHub and GitHub Pages Works

Today, I spent some time completing the Introduction to GitHub course. Here's a recap of all the tasks I accomplished in this repository:
- Learned about issues, pull requests, and the structure of a GitHub repository
- Learned about branching
- Created a commit
- Viewed and responded to pull request reviews
- Edited an existing file
- Enabled GitHub Pages
- Made my first contribution! ðŸŽ‰

Now, I'm learning how to build my own website using the GitHub pages platform. Here's what I learned:
- How to enable GitHub Pages
- How to select a theme using the config file
- How to use proper directory format and file naming conventions in Jekyll
- How to add and modify Jekyll front matter

Stay tuned for more updates to my site!
