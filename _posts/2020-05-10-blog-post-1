# My first blog post: Learning How GitHub Pages Works

Today, I spent some time completing the Introduction to GitHub course. Here's a recap of all the tasks I accomplished in this repository:

- Learned about issues, pull requests, and the structure of a GitHub repository
- Learned about branching
- Created a commit
- Viewed and responded to pull request reviews
- Edited an existing file
- Enabled GitHub Pages
- Made my first contribution! 🎉

Now, I'm learning how to build my own website using the GitHub pages platform.
